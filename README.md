👨‍💻 About Me
Hi, I’m a final-year Computer Science student with a passion for building real-world software solutions.

✅ I’ve completed an industry-level academic project as part of my coursework.

✅ I’ve also worked on a client-based freelancing project, where I was involved in both the development and deployment process.

💡 I’m currently open to freelancing opportunities and collaborations.

This repository showcases part of my work and serves as a way to connect with me for future tech projects.
